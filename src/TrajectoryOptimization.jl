"""
    TrajectoryOptimization
Primary module for setting up and solving trajectory optimization problems with
iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR). Module supports unconstrained and
constrained optimization problems. Constrained optimization problems are solved
using Augmented Lagrangian methods. Supports automatic differentiation via the
`ForwardDiff` package.
