A handful of high-quality NLP solvers exist, such as Ipopt, Snopt, and KNITRO. TrajectoryOptimization provides an interface that allows methods that are amenable to use with a general-purpose NLP solver. In the NLP, the states and constraints at every knot point are concatenated into a single large vector of decision variables, and the cost hessian and constraint Jacobians are represented as large, sparse matrices.","category":"page"},{"location":"nlp.html#Important-Types","page":"Converting to an NLP","title":"Important Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"nlp.html","page":"Converting to an NLP","title":"Converting to an NLP","text":"Below is the documentation for the types used to represent a trajectory optimization problem as an NLP:","category":"page"},{"location":"nlp.html","page":"Converting to an NLP","title":"Converting to an NLP","text":"NLPData\nNLPConstraintSet\nQuadraticViewCost\nViewKnotPoint\nTrajData\nNLPTraj","category":"page"},{"location":"nlp.html#TrajectoryOptimization.NLPData","page":"Converting to an NLP","title":"TrajectoryOptimization.NLPData","text":"Holds all the required data structures for evaluating a trajectory optimization problem as \tan NLP.
